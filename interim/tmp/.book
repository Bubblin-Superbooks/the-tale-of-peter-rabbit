It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.</p>",

It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.</p>",

He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.</p><p>Presently Peter sneezed—'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in no time.</p><p>And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.</p>",
  "page-24": "<img width = \"98%\" src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/the-tale-of-peter-rabbit/master/assets/images/peter40.jpg\" /><img width = \"90%\" src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/the-tale-of-peter-rabbit/master/assets/images/peter43.jpg\" /><p>Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.</p><p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all round.</p><p>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p><p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.</p>",

Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.</p><p>He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!</p>",

He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.</p><p>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.</p><p>Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.</p>",

His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!</p><p>I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.</p><p>His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!</p><p>'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'</p>",
