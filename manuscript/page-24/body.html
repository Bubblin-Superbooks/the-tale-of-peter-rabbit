Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.</p><p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all round.</p><p>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p><p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.</p></div> </div>
